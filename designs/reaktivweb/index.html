                        distribution and analytics segment, leveraging off
                        its experience in the business registry and regulated data domains. This has culminated recently
                        with the selection of REAKTIV as implementer of the Balkan Regional Registry Portal, which aims
                        to
                        connect various regional commercial registry agencies, along with their data, to a single
                        platform.
                        The Portal is envisioned as a hub for business and related data services and REAKTIV is excited
                        to
                        partake in this unique endeavor.

                        The Regional Business Registry Portal (www.bifidex.com) is a platform that directly connects the
                        business registration authorities from the region. Set as an advanced interoperability engine,
                        it allows exchange of official registry data supporting creation of numerous value added
                        services for the entire business community. The Bifidex platform provides official, reliable and
                        accurate information for the legal entities, as well as their financial data. By creation of
                        integrated cross-border data mashups, the users can trust the portal in their effort to make
                        informed business decisions.

                    <p>
                        REAKTIV’s experience and know-how in the business registration domain, as well as its deep
                        understanding of the customer needs for trustworthy data was essential for the entire project.
                        Our team was directly responsible for the development lifecycle of the platform, including
                        analysis of the data, its value and structure, standardization and mapping of the available
                        information, design of the data consumer services, full technological implementation, as well as
                        setting up the strategy for further expansion by including additional registries and
                        introduction of more valuable services.

                    <p>
                        The portal initially includes corporate and financial data from North Macedonia and Serbia,
                        while most of the other registries in the region have already joined the initiative by signing a
                        Memorandum of Understanding. Many of these have already started internal preparation and are
                        expected to join very soon

                        The improvement of Egypt’s General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) and its One
                        Stop Shop included upgrade of the institutional capacity through process standardization,
                        optimization and redesign, revision of the proposed regulatory upgrades and providing
                        technological review and guidelines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        GAFI relied on REAKTIV’s expertise and guidance for improving the ongoing business registration
                        automation process, as well as planning its further improvement into a single point for business
                        registration, covering the entire business lifecycle and all legal entity types in Egypt.
                        REAKTIV also provided a design for a Point of Single Contact licensing mechanism for
                        orchestration of the activities of 70+ government authorities that provide a specific business
                        activity related license. The proposed design would allow GAFI to replicate the same setup at
                        numerous locations across Egypt, which was impossible through an entirely physical approach.
                        REAKTIV was also required to develop a proposal for standardization and optimization of other
                        investment related procedures (e.g. streamlining the procedures for registration of employees,
                        acquiring work permits and visas etc.).

                    <p>
                        By combining the needs of the institution and its customers, REAKTIV’s domain expertise
                        maximized the opportunities for GAFI’s One Stop Shop by providing a vision, roadmap and
                        implementation strategy as basis for its further development.

                        Macedonia’s One Stop Shop project is one of the largest and most significant e-government
                        projects implemented in the country. Upon completion, it propelled the country to 1st place in
                        Europe and 2nd place globally in the World Bank's Doing Business in the Starting a Business

                            <li> a) electronic filing and registration of legal entities (i.e. businesses, as well as

                    <p>
                        Perhaps the most significant outcome from the work performed by REAKTIV is the ability to
                        register a trade company in Republic of Macedonia online and do this within just four hours,
                        regardless of whether the registration is done by a native or foreign national. Furthermore, the
                        project implemented vital capability for interoperability among institutions, introduced proven
                        standards for data exchange at inter-institutional level, enabled electronic payment of fees and
                        increased the level of transparency in bankruptcy proceedings, pledges and leases on property.

                        The design and development of the Lebanese Government Interoperability Framework and Reference
                        Architecture project saw REAKTIV put in place the basis for implementation of government
                        interoperability in the Republic of Lebanon. Focus of the project was developing and
                        implementing the regulatory, organizational, procedural and semantic mechanisms that would
                        enable, as a starting point, implementation of a full-blown One Stop Shop for Business
                        Registration. To this end, REAKTIV worked closely with the Commercial Registry Committee,
                        established upon recommendation in the early stages of the project through a decree issued by
                        the Presidency of the Council of Ministers. Together, the working group managed to drive one of
                        the biggest recent reforms in Lebanon, aligning the strategies and visions of key business
                        environment stakeholders, including the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Finance, National
                        Social Security Fund and BAR Association. At the successful conclusion of the initial project
                        scope, REAKTIV was further hired to perform preparatory work for prospective implementation of
                        the interoperability setup and OSS for business registration, providing support in terms of
                        scoping required work, prescribing semantic interoperability tools and reconciling legacy data.
                        Implementation activities are planned to commence in early 2018, estimated to last for two years
                        and REAKTIV is already hired to ensure the quality of the implementation efforts.

                        Serbia’s Construction Licensing System is one of REAKTIV’s recent flagship projects, which
                        positioned Serbia as number 10 globally for issuance of construction permits, leapfrogging the
                        country from the Doing Business rank 152 in less than two years. Commonly referred to as
                        eConstruction Permits, the project involved a truly end-to-end reform for Serbia’s construction
                        permits regime. Starting with business process modeling and re-engineering, REAKTIV enabled
                        complete unified procedure for completely electronic issuance of construction permits. Based on
                        the output designs, REAKTIV went on to develop the biggest e-filing and interoperability
                        solution in the country. Using the solution, applicants today can obtain a construction permit
                        within less than 20 days, relying fully on electronic regimes of collaboration between
                        institutions involved in the process. The system allows applicants to file electronically for
                        any step of the unified procedure for issuance of construction permits, covering the whole range
                        of steps from choosing the location and relevant permits for construction on-site, through
                        registration of construction works and obtaining usage permit of the finished construction to
                        the ownership registration of the completed building. By orchestrating the workflow and
                        communication of data and documents between more than 1.000 different public organizations,
                        thousands of public cervants are allowed to make decisions based entirely on digitally signed
                        documents, construction projects and paid fees.

                        The Jordanian One Stop Shop for Investment project was staged in two separate phases that, among
                        other things, delivered the strategy for establishment of a One Stop Shop for investors in the
                        Jordanian Investment Commission (JIC). As part of this effort, JIC was transformed into a point
                        of single contact institution for orchestration of investment-related services, offered by a
                        range of different public institutions in the country. Practical tools which aid and streamline
                        the day-to-day operations were introduced in Phase I, including reengineered and streamlined OSS
                        processes, organizational restructure with re-defined roles/mandates, a standardized application
                        form capturing relevant data, case tracking and reporting mechanisms and strategic roadmap for
                        further development of the institution. Phase II represented a continuation of the work done in
                        Phase I, expanding scope to include optimization focused on the business licensing segment. It
                        culminated in the delivery and launch of JIC’s Electronic Investment Window – an online solution
                        supporting interaction between investors and the JIC. The solution is an online point of single
                        contact for investors, which has the procedural, organizational and other improvements made over
                        the course of both phases built in. In this sense, it allows investors to submit requests and
                        relevant data electronically, captures and stores processed data electronically, thus serving as
                        a management information system and also incorporates a Content Management System, which enables
                        publication of relevant marketing and other information on JIC’s accompanying, new website. As
                        such, it provides more than a sound basis for further development of a fully-online service
                        provisioning channel for JIC.

                        country they happen to reside in. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is
